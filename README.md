#  Weather API app

## Challenge

I designed this application for iPhone 11 and implemented the buttons and labels using the Main.storyboard, and the rest of the graphic part (background & icons) using the Sketch application.

I've managed to create a weather app that uses the current location to get weather, as well as using the city name that the user types in through the text field. And in the process, I've commented about text field, protocols and delegates, extensions, networking with URL session, as well as parsing JSON data.
